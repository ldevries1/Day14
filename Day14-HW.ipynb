    "**Q1** A major benefit of utilizing algorithms to make decisions is the efficiency that is created. These algorithmns are much much faster than humans when it comes to generating data. This allows the human to analyze the data and draw conclusions, as opposed to spending a lot of time creating data. On the flip side, this can create some bias. Certain groups of people can be excluded, or misrepresented in an algorithm based data set. This is shown in the Amazon hiring scenario, where male candidates were preferred in the algorithm. "

    "**Q2** You can train yourself to make the right decisions when you have a view of all potential perspectives. When looking at data, consider it from both sides. Consider questions like \"what are the researchers trying to tell me within this data set?\" Another way you can make sure of your decisions is by removing all personal bias that you have towards a data set. At times, pieces of data can make people feel emotions, especially if there are connections to their personal lives. It is important to remove that bias. "

    "**Q3** When seeing bias in a piece of work, it is important to take a look at which parts of the data are biased. Once we know which parts are biased, we can then think about what influences those biases have on the argument that is being made. Do they support the argument? Or do they go against the argument? You can take action by pointing out these biases to the researchers. At times, biases can be included unintentionally. Show the researchers what variables within the data could be added or removed in order to mitigate bias. "

    "##### This article uses the \"Five Ps\" when it comes to handling data in an ethical manner. The first P is for provenance. This handles where data is coming from and whether it was legally and consentually obtained. The second P is for purpose. The author brings up the question of whether dark web data will stay within the parameters of how it was originally collected. The third P is for protection. The author discusses how long data is available, the ways in which it was protected and even destroyed. The fourth P is for privacy. The author talks about who has access to personally identifiable data as well as access to anonymous data. The fifth P is for preparation. This handles how data was cleaned up prior to presentation. It also considers the accuracy and biases within data sets. "

    "##### I thought this piece was extremely informative and well structured. The use of the \"Five Ps\" made the piece very easy to follow along with. It split up information very nicely. I agree with everything that the author said, as there is nothing that is too opinionated. There was one major quote that I found very interesting. The quote was \"too little anonymization is unacceptable under most government regulations. Too much may make the data useless for marketing\". What struck me here was the first sentence. I was not aware that there were certain government standards involved with too little anonymous data. I would think it is the other way around."

I think it is vital that shared, public data removes bias. The researchers should state their methodologies in order to promote a transparent environment. I also really liked the main idea regarding progress. It feels like oftentimes people believe that the morality involved in data science can hold back a business from expanding. "

The author talked about the purpose of considering the ethical side, while utilizing some examples of bias. One of these examples dealt with hiring algorithms at Amazon in 2017. Men were favored as candidates in the algorithm which raised a multitude of red flags for the ethical side of data. The author also stressed the importance of how businesses must consider data ethics and train their workers in it. I thought this was an important piece, as businesses may overlook this at times."

The part that I found most interesting was a visual that displayed the specific types of data that people give up when they go online. What was surprising to me was that the highest percentage outcome was from social network friends' list. 27% of people give up data through their friends lists on social media. I would have thought it would be web searches and browsing history. "

For example, in a 2021 McKinsey survey \"only 27 percent of some 1000 respondents said that their data professionals actively check for skewed and biased data during data ingestion\". This stat clearly shows that businesses are shrugging the ethical aspects off and mainly concerned with maximizing profits. They do not want to hire people consider ethics nor do they want to take away time from tasks that could be generating profits. "
